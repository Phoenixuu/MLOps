Year 1: Building Strong Foundations & Hands-on Experience

1. Deepen Core AI Knowledge

    Machine Learning Algorithms: Focus on mastering the most commonly used algorithms like decision trees, SVM, k-NN, ensemble methods (Random Forest, XGBoost), and gradient boosting.
    Deep Learning: Gain a solid understanding of deep learning architectures such as CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, GANs, and Transformers. Also, learn about transfer learning and fine-tuning pre-trained models.
    Reinforcement Learning (Optional): If you have an interest in advanced AI topics, get some exposure to reinforcement learning.

2. Practical Implementation & Framework Mastery

    Pytorch & TensorFlow: Get hands-on with both frameworks for neural networks and deep learning models.
    YOLO, Detectron2, Hugging Face: If you’re interested in computer vision and NLP, master these specialized libraries.
    Scikit-learn: Keep using it for classical machine learning algorithms.

3. Specialize in a Domain

    Pick an AI subfield to specialize in, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, or Reinforcement Learning. Dive deep into this area and work on relevant projects.

4. Learn Cloud Services for AI

    Master at least one major cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
        Learn how to deploy machine learning models using services like AWS Sagemaker, Azure ML, or GCP AI Platform.

5. Start Contributing to Open Source or Kaggle

    Contribute to AI projects on GitHub or compete in Kaggle competitions. This will not only enhance your skills but also build your portfolio.
    Continue learning and improving ZenML for MLOps.

6. Key Concepts to Learn in Year 1

    Mathematics for AI: Learn the necessary linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory behind AI algorithms.
    Data Engineering: Build skills in data preprocessing, data augmentation, and handling large datasets (using SQL, Spark, Hadoop).
    APIs & Deployment: Learn to build REST APIs to serve models and deploy them using Docker and Kubernetes.

Key Milestones for Year 1:

    Build and deploy at least 2 end-to-end AI projects (one solo, one with a team).
    Gain basic certifications like Azure AI Engineer or AWS Machine Learning – Specialty.
